            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>
              <p>
                When we first developed this tool, we tested it with white people and found it to
                be accurate in estimating their risk of colorectal cancer. If you are African American,
                Asian American/Pacific Islander, or Hispanic/Latino, this tool can still estimate your
                risk. But, because there is not as much data available for these groups, your results may be less accurate.
              </p>

                In the future, we hope to make this tool more accurate for African Americans,
                Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics/Latinos, as researchers
                complete studies that will provide information to update the tool for these groups.

              <p>
                As you get older, your risk of colorectal cancer gets higher. More than 90 percent

                Height and weight are used to determine your body mass index (BMI).
                It can also be used to measure total body fat and whether a person is
                a healthy weight. Obesity (a problem in which people have too much body fat)
                has been linked to a higher risk of colorectal cancer.

              Question 6: During the past 10 years, did you have a colonoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy?
               (These are medical procedures in which your doctor inserts a tube into
               the rectum to look for signs of cancer or other problems.)
            </div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>
              <p>
                In a sigmoidoscopy, your doctor looks inside your rectum and the lower part
                 of the colon with a lighted tube called a sigmoidoscope. If anything unusual
                 is in the rectum or colon, like a small polyp or inflamed tissue, your doctor
                 can remove it using the sigmoidoscope. Then, he or she will send that piece of
                 tissue to the lab for testing. In a colonoscopy, your doctor looks inside the
                 rectum and entire colon using a long, lighted tube called a colonoscope.
                 Using a colonoscope, your doctor can remove any polyps he or she sees.
                 The procedure to remove polyps is called a polypectomy. Having this procedure
                 will reduce your risk of colorectal cancer because polyps that can grow
                 into cancer are removed.

              Question 7: During the past 10 years did a doctor tell you that

            </div>
            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>
              <p>
                Polyps are growths on the inner wall of the colon or rectum.
                They are common in people over age 50. Most polyps are not cancer,
                but some can become cancer. Finding and removing polyps may reduce
                the risk of colorectal cancer. [Risk estimates for men for

          <div id="model-exp">
            <p>
              The Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is based on the first absolute risk model for
              colorectal cancer. The model was developed using data from two large U.S. population-based case-control
              studies of colon and rectal cancer, cancer incidence data from 13
              &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://seer.cancer.gov/">NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)</a> registries, and from national mortality rates.  The Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool
              uses the respondent's answers about risk and preventive factors to calculate that person's absolute risk of colorectal cancer for a specific time period.
            </p>
            <p>
              The model was tested in a large population and has been shown to be accurate in predicting absolute risk.
              Because the majority of participants in the case-control studies were non-Hispanic white males and females,
              relative risks for other racial or ethnic groups could not be estimated.  Researchers have since updated the
              tool using SEER rates for African American, Asian American/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic/Latino populations to enable
              the tool to be applicable for men and women in these populations.  As more data becomes available on the African American,
              Asian American/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic/Latino populations, researchers will be able to test and validate the tool for these populations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The risk calculator will be updated periodically as new data or research become available.
              In addition, the tool may prove useful to researchers who are designing research intervention studies.

                When we first developed this tool, we tested it with white
                 people and found it to be accurate in estimating their risk
                 of colorectal cancer. If you are African American, Asian
                 American/Pacific Islander, or Hispanic/Latino, this tool
                 can still estimate your risk. But, because there is not as much data
                 available for these groups, your results may be less accurate.\n In the
                 future, we hope to make this tool more accurate for African Americans,
                 Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics/Latinos, as researchers complete studies
                 that will provide information to update the tool for these groups.\n Although the tool is not
                 perfect, the information you learn from using it can still help you and your doctor better
                 understand your risk of colorectal cancer.

                The Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool was designed for use
                 by doctors and other health providers with their patients.
                If you are not a health provider, take these results to your
                 doctor or other health provider to discuss your personal
                 risk of colorectal cancer. (Colorectal cancer is
                 another way to say colon and rectal cancer).
              </p>
              <p>This tool can estimate the risk of colorectal cancer for men and women who are:</p>

                    In a sigmoidoscopy, your doctor looks inside your rectum

                     he or she will send that piece of tissue to the lab for
                     testing. In a colonoscopy, your doctor looks inside the
                     rectum and entire colon using a long, lighted tube called
                     a colonoscope. Using a colonoscope, your doctor can remove

                     is called a polypectomy. Having this procedure will reduce
                     your risk of colorectal cancer because polyps that can grow

              If you have a problem such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, familial adenomatous polyposis
               (FAP), or Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch Syndrome, you
               should not use this tool to estimate your risk. These problems make your risk of colorectal cancer much higher.
            </li>
            <li>HNPCC, also known as Lynch Syndrome, is the most common type of genetic colorectal cancer. It accounts for about 2 percent of all colorectal cancer cases. It is caused by changes in an HNPCC gene. Most people with these changes in the HNPCC gene develop colorectal cancer, and the average age at diagnosis is 44.</li>
            <li>FAP is a rare, genetic disease in which hundreds of polyps form in the colon and rectum. It is caused by a change in a gene called APC. Unless FAP is treated, it usually leads to colorectal cancer by age 40. FAP accounts for less than 1 percent of all colorectal cancer cases.</li>
            <li>Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease both cause inflammation of the colon. If you have either of these diseases over many years, you have a higher risk of colorectal cancer.</li>

          <p><strong>Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool SAS Macro</strong></p>
          <p>
            The CCRAT SAS macro allows the user to project absolute colorectal cancer risk according
            to NCI's Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (CCRAT) algorithm in batch mode. Risk
            factor data and projection interval ages can be entered for a group of men or women,
            and corresponding absolute risk projections will be returned. This program may be
            useful for research purposes when one needs risk projections for an entire study
            population.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool Gauss Program</strong></p>
          <p>
            The CCRAT Gauss Program is an executable that allows the user to project absolute
            colorectal cancer risk according to NCI's Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (CCRAT) algorithm
            in the batch mode. It also computes 95% confidence intervals for the risk projections.
            Risk factor data and projection interval ages can be entered for a group of men
            or women, and corresponding absolute risk projections will be returned. This program
            may be useful for research purposes when one needs risk projections for an entire
            study population. The program requires either a 32-bit or a 64-bit system.
