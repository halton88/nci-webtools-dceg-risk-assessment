                    |  time. For this reason, breast cancer is more common among older women.

                    |  The original Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool was based on data from white women.
                    |  But race/ethnicity can influence the calculation of breast cancer risk. Over the
                    |  years, as additional data became available, researchers at the NCI updated the tool
                    |  to more accurately estimate risk for African American, and Asian and Pacific Islander
                    |  women. (see references 5 and 6). For Hispanic women, part of the model is derived
                    |  from white women who participated in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project
                    |  and from SEER data. The risk estimates for Hispanic women are therefore subject
                    |  to greater uncertainty than those for white women. Calculations for American Indian

                | The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool will estimate a woman's risk of developing
                | invasive breast cancer during the next 5-year period and up to age 90 (lifetime
                | risk) based on the woman's age and the risk factor information provided. For comparison,
                | the tool will then calculate 5-year and lifetime risk estimates for a woman of the
                | same age who is at average risk for developing breast cancer. Lifetime risk estimates
                | are higher than 5-year age interval estimates because breast cancer risk increases
                | with years at risk.
            p
                | Risk estimates calculated by the tool are estimates of absolute breast cancer risk.
                | Absolute breast cancer risk is the chance or probability of developing invasive
                | breast cancer in a defined age interval. One way to evaluate the accuracy of the
                | risk estimate is to determine whether it correctly predicts average risk in a group
                | of women with the same risk factors and age. The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool
                | does predict such average risks well.
            p
                | Although a woman's risk may be accurately estimated, these predictions do not allow
                | one to say precisely which woman will develop breast cancer. In fact, some women
                | who do not develop breast cancer have higher risk estimates than some women who
                | do develop breast cancer.

            |  medical history, her own reproductive history, and the history of breast cancer
            |  among her first-degree relatives (mother, sisters, daughters) to estimate her risk
            |  of developing invasive breast cancer over specific periods of time. Data from the
            |  Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP), which was a joint NCI and
            |  American Cancer Society breast cancer screening study that involved 280,000 women
            |  aged 35 to 74 years, and from NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
            |  (SEER) Program were used in developing the model. Estimates for African American

            |  (CARE) Study and from SEER data. CARE participants included 1,607 women with invasive
            |  breast cancer and 1,637 without. Estimates for Asian and Pacific Islander women
