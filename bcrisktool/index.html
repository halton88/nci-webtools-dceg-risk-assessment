            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>
              <p>
                The tool is not for use by women who have a diagnosis of breast cancer. In addition,
                 a medical history of&nbsp;<a data-term="dcis" class="termToDefine">ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-term="lcis" class="termToDefine">lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)</a> increases the risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The method used by the
                 Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool to calculate the risk of invasive breast cancer
                 is not accurate for women with a history of DCIS or LCIS. In addition, the tool
                 cannot accurately predict the risk of another breast cancer for women who have a
                 medical history of breast cancer.
                <p>
                  Further, the tool is not appropriate for women who have had previous radiation therapy
                   to the chest for treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma. There may be more appropriate tools
                   for these women. See the "<a href="#model-exp">About the Gail Model</a>" section.

                 Although the tool has been used with success in clinics for women with strong family
                 histories of breast cancer, more specific methods of estimating risk are appropriate

                 such as Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, that increase a woman's risk for breast cancer. This
                 tool will not appropriately estimate breast cancer risk for such women. There may
                 be more appropriate tools for these women. See the "<a href="#model-exp">About the Gail Model</a>" section.

            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>
              <p>
                The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The great majority of breast
                 cancer cases occur in women older than age 50. Most cancers develop slowly over
                 time. For this reason, breast cancer is more common among older women.<em>
                  Note: This tool only calculates risk for women 35 years of age
                  or older.</em>

            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>
              <p>
                 Women who had their first menstrual period before age 12 have a slightly increased
                 risk of breast cancer. The levels of the female hormone estrogen change with the
                 menstrual cycle. Women who start menstruating at a very young age have a slight
                 increase in breast cancer risk that may be linked to their longer lifetime exposure
                 to estrogen.

                 Women who have had breast biopsies have an increased risk of breast cancer, especially

            <div class="about-question-explanation"><strong>Explanation</strong>
              <p>(Question 8)<br> The original Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool was based on data from white women.
                 But race/ethnicity can influence the calculation of breast cancer risk. Over the
                 years, as additional data became available, researchers at the NCI updated the tool
                 to more accurately estimate risk for African American, and Asian and Pacific Islander
                 women. (see references 5 and 6). For Hispanic women, part of the model is derived
                 from white women who participated in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project
                 and from SEER data. The risk estimates for Hispanic women are therefore subject
                 to greater uncertainty than those for white women. Calculations for American Indian
                 and Alaskan Native women are based entirely on data for white women and may not
                 be accurate. Recent immigrants from rural China and certain other parts of Asia
                 probably have lower risk than predicted by the model. Researchers are conducting
                 additional studies, including studies with minority populations, to gather more
                 data and to increase the accuracy of the tool.<em><strong>
                    Note: If the woman's race/ethnicity is unknown,
                    the tool will use data for white females
                    to estimate the predicted risk.</strong></em>
              </p>
              <p>(Question 8a)<br>To calculate breast cancer risk using Asian-American as the race/ethnicity, the
                 sub race/ethnicity needs to be known. If the sub-category of race/ethnicity is not
                 known, then "Unknown" should be selected in Question 8, rather than Asian-American.
                 The "Other Asian American" category includes women of Asian Indian/Pakistani, Korean,
                 Vietnamese, Laotian, and Kampuchean descent. The "Other Pacific Islander" category
                 includes women of Guamanian, Samoan, and Tongan descent.

          <div id="results-exp">
            <p>
              The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool will estimate a woman's risk of developing
              invasive breast cancer during the next 5-year period and up to age 90 (lifetime
              risk) based on the woman's age and the risk factor information provided. For comparison,
              the tool will then calculate 5-year and lifetime risk estimates for a woman of the
              same age who is at average risk for developing breast cancer. Lifetime risk estimates
              are higher than 5-year age interval estimates because breast cancer risk increases
              with years at risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              Risk estimates calculated by the tool are estimates of absolute breast cancer risk.
              Absolute breast cancer risk is the chance or probability of developing invasive
              breast cancer in a defined age interval. One way to evaluate the accuracy of the
              risk estimate is to determine whether it correctly predicts average risk in a group
              of women with the same risk factors and age. The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool
              does predict such average risks well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although a woman's risk may be accurately estimated, these predictions do not allow
              one to say precisely which woman will develop breast cancer. In fact, some women
              who do not develop breast cancer have higher risk estimates than some women who
              do develop breast cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool may be updated periodically as new data or
              research becomes available.

          <div class="exp-title">About the Model</div>
          <div id="model-exp">
            The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is based on a statistical model known as
            the "<strong>Gail model</strong>," which is named after&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/gail-mitchell">Dr. Mitchell Gail</a>, Senior Investigator in the Biostatistics Branch of NCI's
             Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. The model uses a woman's own personal
             medical history, her own reproductive history, and the history of breast cancer
             among her first-degree relatives (mother, sisters, daughters) to estimate her risk
             of developing invasive breast cancer over specific periods of time. Data from the
             Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP), which was a joint NCI and
             American Cancer Society breast cancer screening study that involved 280,000 women
             aged 35 to 74 years, and from NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
             (SEER) Program were used in developing the model. Estimates for African American
             women were based on data from the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences
             (CARE) Study and from SEER data. CARE participants included 1,607 women with invasive
             breast cancer and 1,637 without. Estimates for Asian and Pacific Islander women
             in the United States were based on data from the Asian American Breast Cancer Study
             (AABCS) and SEER data. AABCS participants included 597 Asian and Pacific Islander
             women with invasive breast cancer, and 966 women without breast cancer.
            <p>
              The Gail model has been tested in large populations of white women and has been
              shown to provide accurate estimates of breast cancer risk. In other words, the model
              has been "validated" for white women. It has also been tested in data from the Women's
              Health Initiative for African American women, and the model performs well, but may
              underestimate risk in African American women with previous biopsies.The model has
              been validated for Asian and Pacific Islander women in the WHI and data from SEER.
              The model needs further validation for Hispanic women and other subgroups. Researchers
              are conducting additional studies, including studies with minority populations,
              to gather more data and to test and improve the model.

              Other risk assessment tools are more appropriate for women who have a history of
              certain medical conditions. Below is a list of alternative resources for women with
              a medical history of:

              <li>
                Women with a history of breast cancer have risks of recurrence that depend on the
                type of breast cancer, its stage at diagnosis, and treatment. A cancer doctor can
                provide guidance on future risks for breast cancer survivors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Women with a history of DCIS have risk of invasive breast cancer that depend on
                type of treatment for DCIS; a cancer doctor can provide information on this risk.
              </li>
              <li>Women with a history of LCIS can use the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ems-trials.org/riskevaluator/">IBIS Breast Cancer Risk Evaluation Tool</a> to estimate the risk of invasive
                 breast cancer or DCIS.

                Treatment with radiation to the chest for Hodgkin lymphoma
                Women who had radiation to the chest for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma have
                higher than average risk of breast cancer. These risks are discussed in the scientific
                manuscript Travis, L.B et al. (Journal of the National Cancer Institute 2005; 97:1428-37).

            Anything that increases the chance of developing a disease is called a risk factor.
            Risk factors for breast cancer include the following:</strong>
          <ul class="red-arrow">
            <li>age</li>
            <li>
              age at the start of
              &nbsp;<a data-term="menst" class="termToDefine">menstruation</a>
            </li>
            <li>age at first live birth</li>
            <li>number of first-degree relatives (mother, sisters, daughters) with breast cancer</li>
            <li>
              number of previous breast
              &nbsp;<a data-term="biopsy" class="termToDefine">biopsies</a> (whether positive or negative)
            </li>
            <li>
              at least one breast biopsy with
              &nbsp;<a data-term="ah" class="termToDefine">atypical hyperplasia</a>
            </li>
          </ul><strong>Other risk factors, such as:</strong>
          <ul class="red-arrow">
            <li>age at menopause, dense breast tissue on a mammogram,</li>
            <li>use of birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy,</li>
            <li>a high-fat diet, drinking alcohol,</li>
            <li>low physical activity, obesity, or environmental exposures</li>
          </ul>are not included in risk estimates with the Breast Cancer
           Risk Assessment Tool for three reasons:
           evidence is not conclusive or researchers cannot accurately determine how much these
           factors contribute to the calculation of risk for an individual woman, or adding
           these factors does not increase the accuracy of the tool appreciably.
          <p>
            Breast cancer may also be caused by inherited gene mutations. Hereditary breast
            cancers account for approximately 5% to 10% of all breast cancers. Specific hereditary
            predispositions for breast cancer, such as inheriting a mutation in either the
            &nbsp;<a data-term="brca1" class="termToDefine">brca1</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-term="brca2" class="termToDefine">brca2</a> gene, are not taken into account in risk estimates with
             the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool. Although the tool performs well in clinics
             where women have a strong family history of breast cancer, more specific methods
             for projecting risk are appropriate if a woman is known to carry a breast cancer-producing
             mutation in
            &nbsp;<a data-term="brca1" class="termToDefine">brca1</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-term="brca2" class="termToDefine">brca2</a>&nbsp;. See "<a href="#about" name="about" class="goToTab">About the Tool</a>" for more information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Researchers are, however, conducting additional studies to gather more data and
             to determine whether including information on other risk factors can strengthen
             the statistical model, called the Gail model
             , upon which the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is based. Nonetheless,
             the current
             model estimates breast cancer risk accurately on average.
